# Project Template

This is the base template for new projects created by `create_project_structure.py`.

## Structure

The actual project structure is created by the script:
- `src/` - source code
- `tests/` - test code
- `docs/` - documentation organized by 5 phases
- `.context/` - project context and indexes
- `.checkpoints/` - project snapshots
- `sop.yaml` - project SOP configuration
- `requirements.md` - project requirements

## Usage

This template directory can contain default files that will be copied to new projects.
Currently it's minimal, and the script creates the structure dynamically.
